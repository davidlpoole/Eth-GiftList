# Merkle Tree Gift List üéÅ
### Ethereum Developer Bootcamp Week 2 Project

Hey there! üëã

Blockchains have a storage problem. They require that nodes in the network store every value recorded in their shared database. 
For ethereum this means all account balances, as well as every persistent variable on a smart contract. 
When working with smart contracts we need to be careful how much data we are storing on the blockchain. 
The less data we store, the cheaper it will be.

The aim of project is to build an application which gives out gifts, but only to names on the nice list `niceList.json`. 
The catch is that on the server you are only allowed to store one 32 byte value in the server memory. 
This 32 byte value has to be enough for the server to be able to determine who is on the list.

### Solution:
The client is the prover. They are the ones trying to prove to the server that the name is in the list. 
The server is the verifier. They are taking the client's proof and, using minimal information (the 32 byte merkle root), able to verify that the name sent from the client is actually in the list.


## Getting started

To get started with the repository, clone it and then run `npm install` in the top-level directory to install the depedencies.

There are three folders in this repository:

## Client

You can run the client from the top-level directory with `node client/index`. This file is a script which will send an HTTP request to the server.

Think of the client as the _prover_ here. It needs to prove to the server that some `name` is in the `MERKLE_ROOT` on the server. 

## Server

You can run the server from the top-level directory with `node server/index`. This file is an express server which will be hosted on port 1225 and respond to the client's request.

Think of the server as the _verifier_ here. It needs to verify that the `name` passed by the client is in the `MERKLE_ROOT`. If it is, then we can send the gift! 

## Utils

There are a few files in utils:

- The `niceList.json` which contains all the names of the people who deserve a gift this year (this is randomly generated, feel free to add yourself and others to this list!)
- The `example.js` script shows how we can generate a root, generate a proof and verify that some value is in the root using the proof. Try it out from the top-level folder with `node/example.js`
- The `MerkleTree.js` should look familiar from the Merkle Tree module! This one has been modified so you should not have to deal with any crypto type conversion. You can import this in your client/server
- The `verifyProof.js` should also look familiar. This was the last stage in the module. You can use this function to prove a name is in the merkle root, as show in the example.
